# ImageGeneticAlgorithm

## Introduction
This project implements the Genetic Algorithm to recreate the pixel art of Homer Simpsion. Genetic algorithm
mimics the process of natural selection where the most fittest and best sample from population are selected
to breed so that their genetic meterial i.e.DNA, we are interested in, is passed to their offspring. This process
is repeated again and again so best of the best genetic materials are only passed to next generation.

In this program the image is a entity of the population and the genetic material is the pixel RGB value.

## Technologies and programming language

## Project status
This project is completed. You can clone the repo and run it on processing. You can change parameters like
mutation rate and population size to see how these parameters effect how fast can it achive the desired goal,
in this case recreating the pixel art of homersimpsion.
